## How It Works

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis**
The tool uses Pollination AI's advanced language models to:
1. Parse and understand code structure
2. Identify algorithmic patterns
3. Analyze loop structures and recursive calls
4. Evaluate data structure usage
5. Generate comprehensive complexity reports

### üìä **Complexity Classification**
- **O(1)** - Constant time (Best)
- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic time (Excellent)
- **O(n)** - Linear time (Good)
- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic time (Acceptable)
- **O(n¬≤)** - Quadratic time (Consider optimization)
- **O(n¬≥)** - Cubic time (Needs improvement)
- **O(2‚Åø)** - Exponential time (Usually problematic)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Binary Search Analysis
```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;
  
  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
    if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
    else right = mid - 1;
  }
  
  return -1;
}
```

**Expected Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: O(log n) in all cases
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Classification: Logarithmic (Excellent performance)

### Example 2: Bubble Sort Analysis
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

**Expected Analysis:**
- Time Complexity: O(n¬≤) worst and average case, O(n) best case
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Classification: Quadratic (Consider optimization)
